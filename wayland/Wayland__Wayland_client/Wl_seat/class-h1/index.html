The argument is a capability enum containing the complete set of capabilities this seat has.</p><p>When the pointer capability is added, a client may create a wl_pointer object using the wl_seat.get_pointer request. This object will receive pointer events until the capability is removed in the future.</p><p>When the pointer capability is removed, a client should destroy the wl_pointer objects associated with the seat where the capability was removed, using the wl_pointer.release request. No further pointer events will be received on these objects.</p><p>In some compositors, if a seat regains the pointer capability and a client has a previously obtained wl_pointer object of version 4 or less, that object may start sending pointer events again. This behavior is considered a misinterpretation of the intended behavior and must not be relied upon by the client. wl_pointer objects of version 5 or later must not send events if created before the most recent event notifying the client of an added pointer capability.</p><p>The above behavior also applies to wl_keyboard and wl_touch with the keyboard and touch capabilities, respectively.</p></dd></dl></div></body></html>
