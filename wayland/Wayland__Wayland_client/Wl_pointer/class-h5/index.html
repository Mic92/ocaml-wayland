The protocol guarantees that each axis_discrete event is always followed by exactly one axis event with the same axis number within the same wl_pointer.frame.

It is sent before a wl_pointer.frame event and carries the source information for all events within that frame.</p><p>The source specifies how this event was generated. If the source is wl_pointer.axis_source.finger, a wl_pointer.axis_stop event will be sent when the user lifts the finger off the device.</p><p>If the source is wl_pointer.axis_source.wheel, wl_pointer.axis_source.wheel_tilt or wl_pointer.axis_source.continuous, a wl_pointer.axis_stop event may or may not be sent. Whether a compositor sends an axis_stop event for these sources is hardware-specific and implementation-dependent; clients must not rely on receiving an axis_stop event for these scroll sources and should treat scroll sequences from these scroll sources as unterminated by default.</p><p>This event is optional. If the source is unknown for a particular axis event sequence, no event is sent. Only one wl_pointer.axis_source event is permitted per frame.</p><p>The order of wl_pointer.axis_discrete and wl_pointer.axis_source is not guaranteed.</p></dd></dl><dl><dt class="spec method" id="method-on_frame"><a href="#method-on_frame" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">method</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> on_frame : <span><span class="type-var">'v</span> <a href="../index.html#type-t">t</a></span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> unit</code></dt><dd><p>End of a pointer event sequence.</p><p>Indicates the end of a set of events that logically belong together. A client is expected to accumulate the data in all events within the frame before proceeding.</p><p>All wl_pointer events before a wl_pointer.frame event belong logically together. For example, in a diagonal scroll motion the compositor will send an optional wl_pointer.axis_source event, two wl_pointer.axis events (horizontal and vertical) and finally a wl_pointer.frame event. The client may use this information to calculate a diagonal vector for scrolling.</p><p>When multiple wl_pointer.axis events occur within the same frame, the motion vector is the combined motion of all events. When a wl_pointer.axis and a wl_pointer.axis_stop event occur within the same frame, this indicates that axis movement in one axis has stopped but continues in the other axis. When multiple wl_pointer.axis_stop events occur within the same frame, this indicates that these axes stopped in the same instance.</p><p>A wl_pointer.frame event is sent for every logical event group, even if the group only contains a single wl_pointer event. Specifically, a client may get a sequence: motion, frame, button, frame, axis, frame, axis_stop, frame.</p><p>The wl_pointer.enter and wl_pointer.leave events are logical events generated by the compositor and not the hardware. These events are also grouped by a wl_pointer.frame. When a pointer moves from one surface to another, a compositor should group the wl_pointer.leave event within the same wl_pointer.frame. However, a client must not rely on wl_pointer.leave and wl_pointer.enter being in the same wl_pointer.frame. Compositor-specific policies may require the wl_pointer.leave and wl_pointer.enter event being split across multiple wl_pointer.frame groups.</p></dd></dl></div></body></html>
