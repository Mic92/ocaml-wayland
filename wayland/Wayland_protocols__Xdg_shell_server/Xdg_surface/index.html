In order to map an xdg_surface, the client must create a role-specific object using, e.g., get_toplevel, get_popup. The wl_surface for any given xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role not based on xdg_surface.</p><p>A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the xdg_surface object.</p><p>The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface for the xdg_surface state to take effect.</p><p>Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must also be treated as errors.</p><p>After creating a role-specific object and setting it up, the client must perform an initial commit without any buffer attached. The compositor will reply with an xdg_surface.configure event. The client must acknowledge it and is then allowed to attach a buffer to map the surface.</p><p>Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.</p><p>For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following conditions must be met: (1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface (2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the role-dependent state to the surface (3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface</p><p>A newly-unmapped surface is considered to have met condition (1) out of the 3 required conditions for mapping a surface if its role surface has not been destroyed.</p><nav class="toc"><ul><li><a href="#version-1,-2,-3">Version 1, 2, 3</a></li></ul></nav></header><dl><dt class="spec type" id="type-t"><a href="#type-t" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">type</span> <span>'v t</span></code><code> = <span><span>(<span>[ `Xdg_surface ]</span>, <span class="type-var">'v</span>, <span>[ `Server ]</span>)</span> <a href="../../Wayland/Proxy/index.html#type-t">Proxy.t</a></span></code></dt></dl><div class="spec module" id="module-Error"><a href="#module-Error" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">module</span> Error = <a href="../../Wayland_protocols/Xdg_shell_proto/Xdg_surface/index.html#module-Error">Wayland_protocols.Xdg_shell_proto.Xdg_surface.Error</a></code></div><section><header><h3 id="version-1,-2,-3"><a href="#version-1,-2,-3" class="anchor"></a>Version 1, 2, 3</h3></header><dl><dt class="spec value" id="val-configure"><a href="#val-configure" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">val</span> configure : <span><span>[&lt; `V1 <span>| `V2</span> <span>| `V3</span> ]</span> <a href="index.html#type-t">t</a></span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> <span>serial:int32</span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> unit</code></dt><dd><p>Suggest a surface change.</p><p>The configure event marks the end of a configure sequence. A configure sequence is a set of one or more events configuring the state of the xdg_surface, including the final xdg_surface.configure event.</p><p>Where applicable, xdg_surface surface roles will during a configure sequence extend this event as a latched state sent as events before the xdg_surface.configure event. Such events should be considered to make up a set of atomically applied configuration states, where the xdg_surface.configure commits the accumulated state.</p><p>Clients should arrange their surface for the new states, and then send an ack_configure request with the serial sent in this configure event at some point before committing the new surface.</p><p>If the client receives multiple configure events before it can respond to one, it is free to discard all but the last event it received.</p></dd></dl><div class="spec class" id="class-handlers"><a href="#class-handlers" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> +'a <a href="class-handlers/index.html">handlers</a> : <span class="keyword">object</span> ... <span class="keyword">end</span></code></div></section></div></body></html>
