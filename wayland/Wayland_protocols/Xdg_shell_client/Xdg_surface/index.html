In order to map an xdg_surface, the client must create a role-specific object using, e.g., get_toplevel, get_popup. The wl_surface for any given xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role not based on xdg_surface.</p><p>A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the xdg_surface object.</p><p>The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface for the xdg_surface state to take effect.</p><p>Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must also be treated as errors.</p><p>After creating a role-specific object and setting it up, the client must perform an initial commit without any buffer attached. The compositor will reply with an xdg_surface.configure event. The client must acknowledge it and is then allowed to attach a buffer to map the surface.</p><p>Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.</p><p>For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following conditions must be met: (1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface (2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the role-dependent state to the surface (3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface</p><p>A newly-unmapped surface is considered to have met condition (1) out of the 3 required conditions for mapping a surface if its role surface has not been destroyed.</p><nav class="toc"><ul><li><a href="#version-1,-2,-3">Version 1, 2, 3</a></li></ul></nav></header><dl><dt class="spec type" id="type-t"><a href="#type-t" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">type</span> <span>'v t</span></code><code> = <span><span>(<span>[ `Xdg_surface ]</span>, <span class="type-var">'v</span>, <span>[ `Client ]</span>)</span> <a href="../../../Wayland/Proxy/index.html#type-t">Proxy.t</a></span></code></dt></dl><div class="spec module" id="module-Error"><a href="#module-Error" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">module</span> Error = <a href="../../Xdg_shell_proto/Xdg_surface/index.html#module-Error">Xdg_shell_proto.Xdg_surface.Error</a></code></div><section><header><h3 id="version-1,-2,-3"><a href="#version-1,-2,-3" class="anchor"></a>Version 1, 2, 3</h3></header><dl><dt class="spec value" id="val-ack_configure"><a href="#val-ack_configure" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">val</span> ack_configure : <span><span>[&lt; `V1 <span>| `V2</span> <span>| `V3</span> ]</span> <a href="index.html#type-t">t</a></span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> <span>serial:int32</span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> unit</code></dt><dd><p>Ack a configure event.</p><p>When a configure event is received, if a client commits the surface in response to the configure event, then the client must make an ack_configure request sometime before the commit request, passing along the serial of the configure event.</p><p>For instance, for toplevel surfaces the compositor might use this information to move a surface to the top left only when the client has drawn itself for the maximized or fullscreen state.</p><p>If the client receives multiple configure events before it can respond to one, it only has to ack the last configure event.</p><p>A client is not required to commit immediately after sending an ack_configure request - it may even ack_configure several times before its next surface commit.</p><p>A client may send multiple ack_configure requests before committing, but only the last request sent before a commit indicates which configure event the client really is responding to.</p></dd></dl><dl><dt class="spec value" id="val-set_window_geometry"><a href="#val-set_window_geometry" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">val</span> set_window_geometry : <span><span>[&lt; `V1 <span>| `V2</span> <span>| `V3</span> ]</span> <a href="index.html#type-t">t</a></span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> <span>x:int32</span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> <span>y:int32</span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> <span>width:int32</span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> <span>height:int32</span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> unit</code></dt><dd><p>Set the new window geometry.</p><p>The window geometry of a surface is its &quot;visible bounds&quot; from the user's perspective.
