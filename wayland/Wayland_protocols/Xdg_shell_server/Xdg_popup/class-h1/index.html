An explicit grab will be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup, or when the client destroys the xdg_popup. This can be done by the user clicking outside the surface, using the keyboard, or even locking the screen through closing the lid or a timeout.</p><p>If the compositor denies the grab, the popup will be immediately dismissed.</p><p>This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a button press, key press, or touch down event. The serial number of the event should be passed as 'serial'.</p><p>The parent of a grabbing popup must either be an xdg_toplevel surface or another xdg_popup with an explicit grab. If the parent is another xdg_popup it means that the popups are nested, with this popup now being the topmost popup.</p><p>Nested popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created in, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times is the topmost one.</p><p>When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they may dismiss every nested grabbing popup as well. When a compositor dismisses popups, it will follow the same dismissing order as required from the client.</p><p>The parent of a grabbing popup must either be another xdg_popup with an active explicit grab, or an xdg_popup or xdg_toplevel, if there are no explicit grabs already taken.</p><p>If the topmost grabbing popup is destroyed, the grab will be returned to the parent of the popup, if that parent previously had an explicit grab.</p><p>If the parent is a grabbing popup which has already been dismissed, this popup will be immediately dismissed. If the parent is a popup that did not take an explicit grab, an error will be raised.</p><p>During a popup grab, the client owning the grab will receive pointer and touch events for all their surfaces as normal (similar to an &quot;owner-events&quot; grab in X11 parlance), while the top most grabbing popup will always have keyboard focus.</p></dd></dl><dl><dt class="spec method" id="method-on_destroy"><a href="#method-on_destroy" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">method</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> on_destroy : <span><span class="type-var">'v</span> <a href="../index.html#type-t">t</a></span> <span>&#45;&gt;</span> unit</code></dt><dd><p>Remove xdg_popup interface.</p><p>This destroys the popup.
